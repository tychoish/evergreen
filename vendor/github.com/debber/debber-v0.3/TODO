=====

v0.3
----
~~1. Rename everything to 'debber'~~
2. Consolidate commands into subcommands as much as poss. debber to handle most input
~~3. Refactor deb.Package to use a map for all metadata, with getters plus case-insensitive lookups.~~
4. Enable multiline flags

v0.2
----

~~1. While generating each "meta" file, check resources -> template [file] -> template [string]~~
~~2. Guts of the deb file reader/validator.~~
3. Strip out any more unessentials.
~~4. Deal with resources which shouldn't really be autogenerated - rules (non-Go packages) and changelog.~~
~~5. Ensure all files are in source packages. Check against a dpkg-source build. Include a bash script for this.~~

Secondary
---------

1. Complete test suite & example suite
2. Complete docs 
3. Investigate nesting reader of a .tar.gz within a .ar file (no intermediate file).
